# EV-Data-Analysis - Using Tableau

## Project Overview

In this project we will find the different types of Electric Vehicles produced in the US market with all the specification as per the slected filter sections used. We will see the performance of each vehicle by specific model and make.

## Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the Electric vehicle population data which is a csv file.

## Tool Used

Here i used MS excel for data trensformation and for getting all the analysis and dashboarding. I have done all the task on Tableau Public according to the KPI's requirements. 

## KPIs

-	Total Vehicles
-	AVG Electric Range 
-	Total BEV Vehcles 
-	Total PHEV Vehicles
-	Total Vehicles by Model Year
-	Total Vehicles by State
-	Top 10 Vehicles by Make 
-	Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility 
-	Total Vehicles by Model

## Steps Taken 

- First of all we need to load our raw data file in Excel.
- Next we check the data for any duplicate values or null values.
- We clean the null values or duplicate values to get better accuracy in results.
- First of all we need to load our raw data file in Tableau.
- Next we start analysing the data set according to the given KPI's using Tableau Worksheets.
- With the help of worksheets, we can create some important charts by using drag and drop of important rows and columns for better understanding the results.
- We can use filter for required results for some specific values.
- With the help of filters we can get the result as our requirement.
- After preparing all the data results as per the KPI's we can start building the actionable dashboard.
- We can link the design sheet with the dashboard for actionable results.

## Important Outcomes

- Total Vehicles          = 1,50,413
- AVG Electric Range      = 67.83 Miles
- Total BEV Vehicles      = 1,16,745  in percentage = 77.6%
- Total PHEV Vehicles     = 33,668    in percentage = 22.4%

Rest of the things are given in the data file which is uploaded...
